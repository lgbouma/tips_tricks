In vim, to replace contents of all lines to between quotes with a comma (e.g., a list)

:%s/^\(.*\)$/"\1"/

%s/foo/bar is find-replace in vim

^ is beginning of line, $ is end of line
(.*) matches everything between (and \( \) because protected characters)
\1 is where the captured content is stored
