==============================
QUEUES: 
short 
4 hour wall clock limit
60 job maximum per user
60 processor cores maximum per user
 
medium 
24 hour wall clock limit
80 processor cores maximum
40 processors per user
8 jobs per user
4 nodes per user
 
long 
15 day wall clock limit
8 job maximum per user
40 processor cores maximum per user
80 processor cores maximum allocation
==============================

Practically, this means a single user can have at most 60 cores 
at a given time (on the short queue).
