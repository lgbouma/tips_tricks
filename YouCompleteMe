Actual docs: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#general-usage

Usage:
* Start typing something (e.g., in a `.py` file)
* ctrl-space prompts for list of all options.
* Can tab thru them. Once it's the thing you want, can continue by just typing
  on. Preview window showing important documentation auto-disappears, provided
  your vimrc has the right settings.
