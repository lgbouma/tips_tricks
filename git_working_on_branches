Important concepts: `stash` and `cherry-pick`.

Let's say you committed a good thing to a branch, and you want to move it into master.

A full merge is unnecessary. Instead, cherry-pick.

`git checkout master`
`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

& push it.

---

For this to work, you need to be able to switch to master.

To do so,

`git stash`

and to return and get everything you stashed,

`git stash apply`

or if there are multiple stashed things

`git stash apply stash@{2}`.

You can see everything you've stashed via

`git stash list`
