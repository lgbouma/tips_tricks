```
evince `find *pdf -mtime -0.5 -print`
```

the above is general syntax to send the output of one process as command line
arguments to another process.  for instance, the above command finds all pdfs
in your current directory that have been modified in the past half-day, prints
their names as output, and then sends those as command line arguments to
evince.

```
chmod 755 `ls -d */`

```
changes permissions of all top-level directories in this folder (ls -d lists them)
