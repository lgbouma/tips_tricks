```
evince `find *pdf -mtime -0.5 -print`
```

the above is general syntax to send the output of one process as command line
arguments to another process.  for instance, the above command finds all pdfs
in your current directory that have been modified in the past half-day, prints
their names as output, and then sends those as command line arguments to
evince.

Another way to do this with `find` (though it's specific to `find`) is to call
-exec:

```
find . -name '*.pdf' -exec evince {} \;
```

but this is not as nice.

"How can I recursively find all files in current and subfolders based on
wildcard matching?"

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5905054/how-can-i-recursively-find-all-files-in-current-and-subfolders-based-on-wildcard

find . -name "foo*"

find needs a starting point, and the . (dot) points to the current directory.
