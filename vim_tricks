From terminal:
>>> vi *py

In vimscript:
`:bufdo tab split`

then moves everything from buffers into tabs.

`:bro[wse] ol[dfiles]`
lets you look through recent files you've worked with.

`:help encryption`

On buffers vs tabs:

They are similar. Tabs were only implemented in vim7. `tabe <path>` opens
<path> in a tab. Then something like:
map <F8> :tabn<CR>
map <F7> :tabp<CR>
Maps F7 and F8 to tab switching.

You can do similar things with buffers though.
From bash, `vi *py` opens all python files in working directory in buffers, and
`:e <path>` does the same as `tabe <path>` but for buffers.
`:ls` then lists everything in your buffers. `:bn` and `:bp` go to next and
previous.

This is OK, but right -- you can forget whatever you had in your buffers.

Also, opening things as tabs automatically opens them in buffers too.

You can back out of insert mode with <ctrl+C> rather than <Esc>. (although this
is a bit useless b/c it doesn't work the same way when combining operators)

`set textwidth=72` makes for happy git commits.

For split windows and things:

`ctrl+w, s` horizontally splits screen. So does `:split`.
`ctrl+w, v` horizontally splits screen. So does `:vsplit`.
Then `ctrl+w, <arrow key>` lets you move around.

It kind of becomes a mess with tabs too though. My preference is for just many
tabs, and leafing through them, above split screens.

ALIGNING TEXT:

visual mode, make selection, `gq`. --> will textwrap etc for you. Great for
worry-free editting of big paragraphs, and whenever textwrap fails (e.g., on
wonky filetypes)
