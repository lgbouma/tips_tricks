Mac OS X by default installs BSD core utilities. This has
some unfortunate consequences, like

`ls --help`

will fail.

To fix this, and use the normal options you EXPECT from your utilities, do:

brew install coreutils findutils gnu-tar gnu-sed gawk gnutls gnu-indent gnu-getopt gcc

See https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69223/how-to-replace-mac-os-x-utilities-with-gnu-core-utilities for details

You also need to install vim on new macs.

brew install vim

in your bashrc:
alias vi=/usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.2.0250_1/bin/vim

git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

After ensuring the appropriate new computers and paths are linked in the
.vimrc,

vim +PluginInstall +qall

You may need to export a symlink to the homebrew-installed vim share directory
in order to get proper color schemes etc working.

ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.2.0250_1/share/vim/ /usr/local/share/vim

iTerm settings are also a thing.

* Tabs open in same directory
* Natural text editing mode for modifiers (cmd, alt, etc)
* Appearance: tab width not full.

Then there's also conda
