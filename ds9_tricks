if you have a ds9 session running, e.g., as a background process...

then:

  cat 1-426082d_8.fits | xpaset ds9 fits

is equivalent to opening the new fits file in ds9.

There is also "xpaget". See http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/xpa.html.

See e.g., https://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/xpa/programs.html for some examples.

To change colormap used by ds9:

  xpaset -p ds9 cmap Heat

To change position of crosshair:

  xpaset -p ds9 crosshair 100 100 physical

Drop some circles:

  $echo "image; circle 100 100 20" | xpaset ds9 regions 

  $echo "fk5; circle 13:29:55 47:11:50 .5'" | xpaset ds9 regions
