====================
it is possible to configure the terminal to look slightly different from
defaults.  maybe not worth it though.

====================
to get rid of the annoying transition effect when switching between virtual
desktops,

https://askubuntu.com/questions/58553/turning-off-the-transition-animation-when-changing-workspaces-in-compiz-gnome2

apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager

then Desktop → Desktop Wall → Viewport switching set Wall sliding duration to
0.

you also want to do

Desktop → Desktop Wall → Viewport switch preview
--> turn off show viewport switcher preview
--> turn off show live viewport previews
--> set switch target prview visibility time to 0

====================
TO GET THE FONTS MATPLOTLIB WANTS

sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts -qq

====================
Use "put" to avoid needing to click to move windows between screens

Install CompizConfig Settings Manager:

  sudo apt install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra

Run Compiz from the dash

Click Window Management

Enable the Put plug-in (select the check-box)

Click on Put

Configure the shortcut for Put to next Output (click enable). I like to use
<ctrl+shift+j>, since it matches vim keybindings.

Log out and back in to make changes take effect
