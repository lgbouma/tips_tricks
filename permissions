"read, write, executable"
drwxrw-r--

means: it's a directory, the OWNER (first 3) has rwx, the GROUP MEMBERS have
rw, and all other users only have read.

----------
Generally

want files to be
-rw-rw-r--, 664

and directories as
drwxr-xr-x, 755

for instance, if you loaded everything onto an external drive which fucks up the permissions on EVERYTHING, you can fix via

chmod 755 `find */ -maxdepth 4 -type d`

chmod 664 `find */ -maxdepth 4 -type f`
