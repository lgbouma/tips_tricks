Say you have some images or movies or something you are
producing remotely, but you want to inspect them locally.

X11 forwarding is one option, but it's notoriously slow.

Better idea: mount the folder on your remote server to a local folder, using `sshfs`:

sshfs username@server:/path/to/folder /path/to/mount/point

You can unmount via:

fusermount -u /path/to/mount/point

----------

to do this on MacOS:

first install FUSE
then install SSHFS

both are available from
